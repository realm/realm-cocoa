## Documentation

Our documentation can always be browsed at [http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest](http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest)

You can add it to Xcode or Dash via the links in the upper-right corner of our online docs.

## Plugin

Our Xcode plugin makes it easy to generate new Realm models and inspect your data.

If you use [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/) you will find our plugin under “Realm”.

You can also install the plugin manually by opening tools/RealmTools.xcodeproj contained in the release zip and clicking run. You will need to quit and relaunch Xcode to see our plugin.
