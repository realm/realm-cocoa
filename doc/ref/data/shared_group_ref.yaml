             Sharing groups
DESCR      : &g_shared_group_descr
             >
             Database files can be shared across running applications.

             When two threads or processes want to access the same
             database file, they must each create their own
             instance of SharedGroup.

             If the database file does not already exist, it will
             be created. When multiple threads are involved, it is
             safe to let the first thread, that gets to it, create
             the file.

             While at least one instance of SharedGroup exists for
             a specific database file, a lock file will exist
             too. The lock file will be placed in the same
             directory as the database file, and its name is
             derived by adding the suffix '.lock' to the name of
             the database file.

             Processes that share a database file must reside on
             the same host.

             Moreover, the class also provide a transactional
             interface to TightDB. Transactions are divided into
             read and write transactions. While read transactions
             do not modify the table and thereby the group, write
             transactions do. This division is important to remember
             as derived objects (tables, views, etc.) are either
             writable or not.

                 >
                 Open a shared group (will be created if it does not already exist).

                 By default the shared group will be fully durable, so that each commit writes its changes
                 to disk in an atomic manner that guarantees that the file is always consistent.

                 If your data is transient, and does not need to persist to disk (like for caching or
                 shared state between processes). You can open the shared group in mem-only mode. Then the
                 file will just be used for identification and backing and will be removed again when there
                 are no more processes using it.

                 Note that a shared group can only be opened in the mode it was created in.

                 A SharedGroup may also be constructed in an unattached
                 state (2). See open() and is_attached() for more on
                 this.

                 Is this SharedGroup instance in its attached state?
      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_open_descr
                 Attach this SharedGroup instance to the specified
                 database file.

                 If the database file does not already exist, it will
                 be created (unless <tt>no_create</tt> is set to
                 true.) When multiple threads are involved, it is safe
                 to let the first thread, that gets to it, create the
                 file.

                 While at least one instance of SharedGroup exists for
                 a specific database file, a "lock" file will be
                 present too. The lock file will be placed in the same
                 directory as the database file, and its name will be
                 derived by appending ".lock" to the name of the
                 database file.

                 When multiple SharedGroup instances refer to the same
                 file, they must specify the same durability level,
                 otherwise an exception will be thrown.

                 Calling open() on a SharedGroup instance that is
                 already in the attached state has undefined behavior.

      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_is_attached_descr
                 A shared group may be created in the unattached
                 state, and then later attached to a file with a call
                 to one of the open() methods. Calling any method
                 other than open(), is_attached(), and ~SharedGroup()
                 on an unattached instance results in undefined
                 behavior.

                 This method tests if the shared group has been modified (by another process),
                 since the last transaction.

                 It has very little overhead and does not affect other processes, so it is
                 ok to call it at regular intervals (like in the idle handler of an application).

      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_rollback_descr

      SUMMARY  : &g_shared_group_interrupt_transact_summary
                 Interrupt any blocking call.
      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_interrupt_transact_descr
                 >
                 This function may be called asynchronously to interrupt any
                 blocking call that is part of a transaction in a replication
                 setup. Only {@link g_shared_group_begin_write} and
                 modifying function that are part
                 of a write transaction can block. The transaction is
                 interrupted only if such a call is blocked or would
                 block. This function may be called from a different thread. It
                 may not be called directly from a system signal handler. When
                 a transaction is interrupted, the only valid member function
                 to call is {@link g_shared_group_rollback}. If a client calls
                 {@link g_shared_group_clear_interrupt_transact} after having
                 called {@link g_shared_group_rollback}, it
                 may then resume normal operation on this database/shared group.
                 Currently,
                 transaction interruption works by throwing an exception from
                 one of the mentioned member functions that may block.

                 >
                 This method clears the interrupted state of the shared group after rolling
                 back a transaction. It is not an error to call this function
                 in a situation where no interruption has occured.
