# Sample Project

You'll find a sample Xcode project in the `RLMDemo` directory. It's a very simple project that demonstrates how to create a `UITableViewController` backed by TightDB.

You can add rows by tapping the add button and remove rows by swiping right-to-left.

You'll have to drag in `Tightdb.framework` into the project before being able to run it.

See [tightdb.com](http://tightdb.com) for more documentation.
