# Sample Projects

## TableViewExample

You'll find a sample Xcode project in the `TableViewExample` directory. It's a very simple project that demonstrates how to create a `UITableViewController` backed by Realm.

You can add rows by tapping the add button and remove rows by swiping right-to-left.

The application also demonstrates how to import large amounts of data in a background thread.

You'll have to drag in `Realm.framework` into the project before being able to run it.

See [realm.io](http://realm.io) for documentation and more information about Realm.
