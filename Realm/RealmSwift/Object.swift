/**
In Realm you define your model classes by subclassing RLMObject and adding properties to be persisted.
You then instantiate and use your custom subclasses instead of using the RLMObject class directly.

```swift
class Dog: Object {
    dynamic var name: String = ""
    dynamic var adopted: Bool = false
    let siblings = List<Dog>
}
```

### Supported property types

- `String`
- `Int`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Bool`
- `NSDate`
- `NSData`
- `Object` subclasses for to-one relationships
- `List<T: Object>` for to-many relationships

### Querying

You can gets `Results` of an Object subclass via tha `objects(_:)` free function or
the `objects(_:)` instance method on `Realm`.

### Relationships

See our [Cocoa guide](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa) for more details.
