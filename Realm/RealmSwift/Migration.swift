/**
Specify a schema version and an associated migration block which is applied when
opening any Realm with an old schema version.

Before you can open an existing `Realm` which has a different on-disk schema
from the schema defined in your object interfaces you must provide a migration
block which converts from the disk schema to your current object schema. At the
minimum your migration block must initialize any properties which were added to
existing objects without defaults and ensure uniqueness if a primary key
property is added to an existing object.

You should call this method before accessing any `Realm` instances which
require migration. After registering your migration block Realm will call your
block automatically as needed.

:warning: Unsuccessful migrations will throw exceptions when the migration block
          is applied. This will happen in the following cases:
- The migration block was run and returns a schema version which is not higher
  than the previous schema version.
- A new property without a default was added to an object and not initialized
  during the migration. You are required to either supply a default value or to
  manually populate added properties during a migration.

:param: schemaVersion  The current schema version.
:param: migrationBlock The block which migrates the Realm to the current version.
